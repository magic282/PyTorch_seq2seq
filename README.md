# PyTorch_seq2seq
Sequence to Sequence with attention implemented with PyTorch

This is a fork from [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py).

The master branch now requires PyTorch 0.4.x. There is also a branch called 0.3.0 which supports PyTorch 0.3.x.


## Notes

1. Must use bidirectional GRU by setting `-brnn`.
